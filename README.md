# Home Lab

## Objective

This Home Lab project aimed to create a controlled environment with virtual machines, for simulating and defending against cyber attacks. The focus was on using Kali Linux to launch attacks on an Ubuntu VM, while using UFW for defense and analyzing network traffic with Wireshark. This hands-on experience was designed to enhance my understanding of cybersecurity TTP's, attack methods, and effective defense strategies.

### Skills Learned

- Learnt how to set up, configure and manage virtual environments.
- Experience in penetration testing with Metasploit.
- Developed skills in network traffic analysis using Wireshark.
- Ability to implement and configure firewall defenses with UFW.
- Enhanced understanding of attack patterns and security vulnerabilities.
- Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in cybersecurity.

### Tools Used

- VMware to create and configure the virtual machines.
- Kali Linux, a penetration testing platform to launch an attack.
- Metasploit, a penetration testing framework used to exploit vulnerabilities and simulate attacks
- Wireshark for capturing and examining network traffic.
- UFW, a firewall management tool on Ubuntu for configuring and enforcing security rules.
